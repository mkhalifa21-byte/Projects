# Traffic Light Controller
* This embedded systems lab sequence focused on designing and implementing a traffic-light controller on the STM32F0 microcontroller using C, including sensor inputs, LED outputs, and a finite-state machine to manage traffic and pedestrian behavior.
* In the second phase, the system was extended by interfacing an LCD and a shift register using SPI, and by developing device drivers to control external hardware components.
* Overall, the project emphasized real-time embedded programming, hardware interfacing, debugging, and modular driver design on a microcontroller platform.
* The repository also includes a demonstration video of the physical hardware setup—showing the STM32 board, traffic lights, LCD, and wiring connections—which must be downloaded locally to be viewed.
