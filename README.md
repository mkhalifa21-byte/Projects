# Project Portfolio
* This repository contains a collection of my academic and personal engineering projects in embedded systems, digital logic, and software development. The work includes STM32-based real-time embedded applications, FPGA designs using Verilog HDL, and C/C++ programming assignments focused on data structures, algorithms, and system-level problem solving. These projects demonstrate hands-on experience with microcontroller peripherals, finite state machines, ADC/DAC systems, communication interfaces, and modular software design.

# Highlights
* Embedded systems projects using STM32 microcontrollers in C
* FPGA designs using Verilog HDL and finite state machines
* Real-time hardware interfacing (ADC, DAC, LCD, sensors)
* Communication and control system prototypes
* C/C++ software projects involving data structures and algorithms

* Each folder contains a dedicated README with detailed explanations, code, schematics, and demonstration videos where applicable.
