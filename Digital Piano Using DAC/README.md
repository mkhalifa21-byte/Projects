# Digital Piano Using a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)
* This lab involved designing a simple digital piano on the STM32 microcontroller by generating analog audio signals using a resistor-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC). 
* The project included building a 4-bit DAC circuit, developing modular drivers for the DAC, piano inputs, and sound generation, and using software to produce musical tones.
* The final system demonstrated real-time sound output from the microcontroller, illustrating how digital data can be converted into audible analog waveforms.
* A demonstration video of the digital piano system, showing the STM32 board, DAC circuit, input buttons, and real-time audio output, is available in this repository.
